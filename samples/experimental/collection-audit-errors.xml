EXTREMELY ABSOLUTELY GIGANTICALLY ENORMOUSLY MEGA GIGA TERA SUPER HYPER EXPERIMENTAL
		  						
This is almost certain to change in the future. It does not even belong here well
as this is supposed to be *object* collection and not audit collection. But for now it solves a
couple of problems in dashboards and report functionality, which is also experimental.
Therefore this is a good temporary choice.
However, if you ever rely on this element the karma will get you, eventually.
If that happens, don't come to us crying. You have been warned.
