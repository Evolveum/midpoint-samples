= Compliance Configuration

This project is focused at developing and testing midPoint compliance configuration.

It is a *WORK IN PROGRESS*, yet it is suitable for demo usage.

This is midPoint Studio project.
The objects need to be uploaded in correct order, and in some cases several times (there are dependencies between objects that Studio cannot handle).
Recommended order of directory upload:

. initial
. sample-book
. experiment-tlp
. demo

If you get errors while uploading any particular directory, just try one more time, until the upload is clean.
The `demo` directory should be uploaded or re-uploaded last.

The sample is created for midPoint 4.11 (master branch).
It is tested with midPoint docker image ("devel" tag).
