This directory contains configuration objects that were used to showcase configuration possibilities of request access feature for the webinar.

== Notes

* Authorizations in these samples were simplified, e.g. users have more authorizations than needed.
Reason for this is to make the samples easier to understand, since discussion about authorizations was not primary goal of the webinar.
** If you want to use these samples in your own system, you should adjust the authorizations to match your own system.
