This is a directory for contributed samples. Any contributor is welcome to place a sample here.
The samples are provided by the contributors and they are not reviewed by the maintainers. Those
samples may or may not work, they may be up-to-date or desperately outdated. There can be anything.
Use with care.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Create a directory that is reasonably unique for you. E.g. use your company name, your nick name
or something similar. Then place samples inside that directory. If there are several sets of
samples (e.g. several user stories) then place each set in a separate sub-directory. It is
recommended to write a short description of the sample in a README file in each directory.
