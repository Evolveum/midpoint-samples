= Docker Compose Configuration - Book Samples, Chapter 10

This is a docker compose configuration following the configuration used in midPoint book.

Use the `book-example.sh` script to set up and start the environment:

* `book-example.sh start` starts the containers up.
It also initializes the environment (midPoint home directory) before first start.

* `book-example.sh reset` resets everything to initial state.
All data will be lost.

== Steps To Proceed

The initial state corresponds roughly to the end of chapter 10 (Organizational Structure) of the book.

Following steps can be used to fully initialize the configuration:

. Start/resume `LDAP Reconciliation` task.

. Disable LDAP inbound mapping `uid` -> `name`.

. Change `autoassign-jobcode` mapping for `assignment` in Person object template to active.

. Activate role autoassignment in system configuration.

. Activate `assignment` mapping for `Employee` role in HR resources (in `empno` attribute).

. Reconcile HR resource.


== Structure

Subdirectories:

* `init` has initial configuration used by the containers.

** `midpoint` initial configuration for midPoint (post-initial objects, schema, CSV resources)

** `ldap` initial configuration for OpenLDAP (schema, config and basic entries)

** `postgres` initial configuration for PostgreSQL (DB schema for database resources CRM and Portal)

* `midpoint_home` is midPoint home directory, used by midPoint container.
It is created by the `book-example.sh` script, to make sure it has correct owenership and permissions.
It is then populated by midPoint container at first start.
It is writable, you can modify the resource CSV files and copy connector JARs here.
